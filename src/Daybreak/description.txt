DAYBREAK is a library mod, it's most relevant to other mod developers.

This library is being developed for use in the currently-unreleased mod NIGHTSHADE (feel free to join the Discord in the homepage for more information) as well as a future release of Wrath of the Gods.

It has convenient things like some utilities for IL editing, transient asset replacement, and a whole API for transforming your mod's panel in the Mods List (animated mod icons, shaders applied to panels, etc.).

DAYBREAK's animated panel shaders are by dreitone.
