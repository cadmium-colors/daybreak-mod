# DAYBREAK

Accuracy-focused library mod for tModLoader focusing mostly on reimplementing vanilla features with as much accuracy as possible, along with additional utilities on top.

Current features include:

- modded achievements,
- a brand-new hooking system which you can use to avoid OOP boilerplate,
- completely customizable mod list UI panels,
- various functional sets for NPCs and tiles,
- a rewritten system for determining pot loot that may be hooked into arbitrarily,
- better support for rarity rendering that lets developers apply shaders or other effects in *all* contexts,
- support for lily pad and cattail tiles.
